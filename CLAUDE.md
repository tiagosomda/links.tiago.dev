# Project Instructions

## Inbox/Outbox Communication Sessions

When communicating via inbox/outbox messages:

- Read user messages from `/inbox/*.md`
- Write responses to `/outbox/*.md` (same filename as the inbox message)
- Do not include headers or metadata in output files - just the response text
- Do not output anything to the conversation - ONLY write responses to the outbox file

## Git Workflow

- Always git commit and push changes immediately after making them
- Do not wait for user confirmation before committing/pushing
